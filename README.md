## Inspiration
Kodi is for developers who are tired of the bloat the search engines return when they are looking for quick answers. Built using custom NLP logic, Kodi can help you find answers to your programming problems through simple texts!
## What it does
Kodi can answer questions like:
       * What is java?
       * How do i install python on my mac?
       * How do I fix a ClassNotFound exception?
       * Define 
        * Find code using []
        * I'm looking for examples of []

I tested locally and then deployed my bot to digitalocean on a centos 7 server. I integrated the node.js app with several APIs: and also

## Challenges I ran into
So many! Here are a list of brick walls I hit along the way:

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This entire project! This was my first bot of any kind, and on top of that I was utilizing several new frameworks and APIs - node.js, stackoverflow, facebook messenger. 

## What I learned
I learned how to build a node application from start to finish, generate and integrate certs to make it a secure server.
